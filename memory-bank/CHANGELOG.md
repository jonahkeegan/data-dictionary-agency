# CHANGELOG: The Data Dictionary Agency

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Visualization Engine Foundation (SUBTASK_002.4) implementation progress:
  - Core data models implemented:
    - VisualEntity: Schema entity representation with properties and visual attributes
    - VisualRelationship: Relationship representation with type and cardinality
    - LayoutOptions: Configuration options for layout algorithms

  - Layout algorithms implemented:
    - BaseLayout: Abstract base class for all layout algorithms
    - ForceDirectedLayout: Physics-based layout using force simulation
    - HierarchicalLayout: Tree-like layout based on relationship structure
    - CircularLayout: Arranges entities in a circular pattern
  - Event system implemented:
    - EventBus: Central event system for communication between components
  - Interaction handling implemented:
    - InteractionHandler: Manages user interactions (zoom, pan, select)
    - Support for mouse and touch events
    - Keyboard shortcuts for common operations
  - D3.js Renderer implementation:
    - SVG-based visualization rendering
    - Support for entity and relationship visualization
