## Current Focus
Currently working on **TASK_002: Second Sprint Implementation**

#### ✅ Completed SUBTASK_002.1: Implement Web UI Framework
#### ✅ Completed SUBTASK_002.2: Connect Frontend to Backend API
We are ready to move on to **SUBTASK_002.3: Implement Authentication System**

### Completed Work
- Set up React/Redux frontend architecture
- Created core layout components (Header, Sidebar)
- Implemented page components:
  - Dashboard
  - Repository Browser
  - Schema Viewer
  - Visualization
  - Settings
  - NotFound (404)
- Configured Redux store with slices for data management
- Integrated Chakra UI for styling and component library
- Set up theme configuration
- **Service Layer Implementation**:
  - Developed comprehensive API service architecture
  - Implemented services for repositories, schemas, formats, and authentication
  - Built sophisticated caching system with TTL and pattern-based invalidation
  - Created circuit breaker pattern for API resilience
  - Developed mock services with realistic data for development and testing
  - Created extensive documentation and comprehensive unit tests
    - BaseService tests for core functionality (caching, error handling)
    - RelationshipService tests for CRUD operations
    - Cache system tests with TTL and pattern-based invalidation
    - Circuit breaker tests for fault tolerance and recovery
    - Request cancellation tests for concurrent operations
- **Redux Integration**:
  - Created dedicated Redux slices for repositories, schemas, relationships, and formats
  - Implemented async thunks that utilize service methods
  - Added standardized state management patterns with loading, success, and error states
  - Implemented selectors for efficient state access
  - Added filtering and search capabilities within reducers
- **Custom Hooks System**:
  - Implemented useReduxAction and useReduxThunk utility hooks
  - Created domain-specific hooks (useRepositories, useSchemas, useRelationships, useFormats)
  - Added entity-specific hooks (useRepository, useSchema, useRelationship, useFormat)
  - Implemented relationship-focused hooks (useRelationshipsBySchema, useRelationshipsByRepository)
  - Added automatic data loading with loadImmediately options
  - Implemented consistent loading/error state handling
  - Created tests for hooks using @testing-library/react-hooks

### Current Priority
The next phase focuses on implementing the authentication system:
1. Integrate JWT-based authentication
2. Create login/registration pages
3. Implement protected routes
4. Add user profile management

### Important Components
- #UI_Framework: Core UI architecture and components
- #API_Integration: Connection between frontend and backend
- #AUTH: Authentication system (will be implemented next)

### Technical Decisions
- #UI_001: Using React with Redux for state management
- #TECH_001: Using Chakra UI for component styling
- #UI_002: API Client Architecture with centralized client and interceptors
- #UI_003: Advanced Caching System with TTL and pattern-based invalidation
- #UI_004: Mock Service Architecture for development and testing
- #UI_005: Redux Integration Pattern with service-connected thunks
- #UI_006: Custom React Hooks System for simplified component data access

## Action Items
- [x] Review API endpoint documentation
- [x] Implement API service layer
- [x] Connect Redux thunks to API service
- [x] Add error handling and loading states
- [x] Implement custom hooks for simplified data access
- [x] Create comprehensive test framework for Redux integration
- [x] Update documentation to reflect new architecture
- [x] Test API integration with mock data

### Next Action Items
- [ ] Create login and registration pages
- [ ] Implement JWT authentication flow
- [ ] Add protected route components
- [ ] Create user profile management interface
- [ ] Implement token refresh mechanism

## Notes
The Service Layer implementation and Redux integration have been successfully completed, providing a robust foundation for API communication and state management. We've established a comprehensive architecture with advanced features such as caching, circuit breaking, request cancellation, and custom hooks for simplified data access. The mock services allow for development and testing without a live backend.

The custom hooks system creates a clean, consistent interface for components to access data and perform operations without needing to understand the underlying Redux or API details. This architecture promotes separation of concerns, reusability, and testability throughout the application.

Our next focus is on applying this service layer to implement authentication features. This will leverage the AuthService we've created, integrating JWT tokens, protected routes, and user management. This is a crucial step before allowing users to interact with repository and schema data.
