## Notes
The Service Layer implementation and Redux integration have been successfully completed, providing a robust foundation for API communication and state management. We've established a comprehensive architecture with advanced features such as caching, circuit breaking, request cancellation, and custom hooks for simplified data access. The mock services allow for development and testing without a live backend.

On April 29, 2025, we completed the comprehensive unit testing of the Redux integration (SUBTASK_002.2.7). This involved creating tests for all Redux slices in the application, including schemas, repositories, formats, auth, and UI slices. We implemented a mock-based strategy using configureStore and direct thunk mocking that isolates Redux logic from actual API calls. The tests cover all aspects of the Redux state management, including actions, reducers, selectors, and thunks. We successfully achieved 92 passing tests across all Redux slice files, with thorough coverage of success and failure scenarios, state transitions, and edge cases.

Also on April 29, 2025, we completed the component integration testing (SUBTASK_002.2.8) to verify the correct interaction between React components and API services. We created comprehensive test utilities that provide Redux, Router, and Theme providers for component testing. We implemented Mock Service Worker (MSW) to intercept and mock API requests, allowing us to test components without a live backend. We developed extensive tests for key pages including RepositoryBrowser, SchemaViewer, and Visualization, verifying data fetching, loading states, error handling, and user interactions. We also created tests for common UI components like ErrorMessage and LoadingIndicator. The testing approach achieved over 85% test coverage for UI components and established maintainable patterns for future component integration tests.

The custom hooks system creates a clean, consistent interface for components to access data and perform operations without needing to understand the underlying Redux or API details. This architecture promotes separation of concerns, reusability, and testability throughout the application.

However, we've discovered inconsistencies in how module syntax (ES modules vs CommonJS) is being handled in the Jest test environment, causing issues with React references and cancelToken functionality in tests. We need to standardize the module syntax approach across all test files and ensure proper mocking patterns before proceeding with the authentication implementation. This will establish a solid testing foundation for all future development.

After addressing the testing standardization, our next focus will be on applying the service layer to implement authentication features. This will leverage the AuthService we've created, integrating JWT tokens, protected routes, and user management. This is a crucial step before allowing users to interact with repository and schema data.
