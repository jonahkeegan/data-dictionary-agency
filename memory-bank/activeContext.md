## Current Focus
Currently working on **TASK_002: Second Sprint Implementation**

#### ✅ Completed SUBTASK_002.1: Implement Web UI Framework
#### ✅ Completed SUBTASK_002.2: Connect Frontend to Backend API
We are ready to move on to **SUBTASK_002.3: Implement Authentication System**

### Completed Work
- Set up React/Redux frontend architecture
- Created core layout components (Header, Sidebar)
- Implemented page components:
  - Dashboard
  - Repository Browser
  - Schema Viewer
  - Visualization
  - Settings
  - NotFound (404)
- Configured Redux store with slices for data management
- Integrated Chakra UI for styling and component library
- Set up theme configuration
- **Service Layer Implementation**:
  - Developed comprehensive API service architecture
  - Implemented services for repositories, schemas, formats, and authentication
  - Built sophisticated caching system with TTL and pattern-based invalidation
  - Created circuit breaker pattern for API resilience
  - Developed mock services with realistic data for development and testing
  - Implemented custom React hooks for API integration
  - Created extensive documentation and unit tests

### Current Priority
The next phase focuses on implementing the authentication system:
1. Integrate JWT-based authentication
2. Create login/registration pages
3. Implement protected routes
4. Add user profile management

### Important Components
- #UI_Framework: Core UI architecture and components
- #API_Integration: Connection between frontend and backend
- #AUTH: Authentication system (will be implemented next)

### Technical Decisions
- #UI_001: Using React with Redux for state management
- #TECH_001: Using Chakra UI for component styling
- #UI_002: API Client Architecture with centralized client and interceptors
- #UI_003: Advanced Caching System with TTL and pattern-based invalidation
- #UI_004: Mock Service Architecture for development and testing

## Action Items
- [x] Review API endpoint documentation
- [x] Implement API service layer
- [x] Connect Redux thunks to API service
- [x] Add error handling and loading states
- [x] Test API integration with mock data

### Next Action Items
- [ ] Create login and registration pages
- [ ] Implement JWT authentication flow
- [ ] Add protected route components
- [ ] Create user profile management interface
- [ ] Implement token refresh mechanism

## Notes
The Service Layer implementation has been successfully completed, providing a robust foundation for API communication. We've established a comprehensive architecture with advanced features such as caching, circuit breaking, and request cancellation. The mock services allow for development and testing without a live backend.

Our next focus is on applying this service layer to implement authentication features. This will leverage the AuthService we've created, integrating JWT tokens, protected routes, and user management. This is a crucial step before allowing users to interact with repository and schema data.
