5. Optimize performance for large repositories

## Critical Dependencies

| Component | Dependency | Status |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| Repository Connector | GitHub API | Implemented ‚úÖ |
| Format Detection | Parser Plugins | Initial parsers implemented ‚úÖ |
| Type Inference | Enhancer Plugins | Implemented ‚úÖ |
| Schema Storage | Database Schema | Implemented ‚úÖ |
| Test Framework | Core Infrastructure | Implemented ‚úÖ |
| Project Hosting | GitHub Repository | Implemented ‚úÖ |

## Applied Patterns

The implementation follows these key patterns:

1. **Plugin Architecture** (@Plugin): Used for format detection with a registry system for parsers
2. **Strategy Pattern** (@Strategy): Applied for implementing different format detection algorithms
3. **Factory Method** (@Factory): Used for creating parser instances based on format
4. **Repository Pattern** (@Repository): Implemented for data access abstraction
5. **Enhancer Pattern** (@Enhancer): Applied for type inference with sequential enhancement pipeline

## Key Decisions

1. **#ARCH_001**: Microservice architecture with containerized components
2. **#TECH_001**: Python/FastAPI for backend, React for frontend
3. **#DB_001**: PostgreSQL for relational data, MongoDB for schema storage
4. **#ARCH_002**: Plugin-based architecture for format detection
5. **#TECH_002**: GitHub integration using PyGithub library
6. **#FD_001**: Confidence-based type inference system with multiple enhancers

## Implementation Notes

The core infrastructure follows the planned architecture with some key decisions:

- FastAPI is used for the API layer with async/await pattern for all operations
- GitHub integration uses PyGithub library with custom abstraction layer
- Format detection uses a confidence-based scoring system for format identification
- Type inference enhances base types with contextual information and confidence scoring
- Database layer supports both PostgreSQL (relational data) and MongoDB (schema storage)
- Project is now hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/jonahkeegan/data-dictionary-agency with MIT license

## Validation Status

Initial validation confirms that the core components are working as expected:

- Repository connector successfully interacts with GitHub API
- Format detection correctly identifies JSON and CSV formats
- Type inference system properly enhances type information with high confidence
- API endpoints return appropriate responses for all operations
- Docker containerization works for the development environment
- Unit tests are passing for all implemented components

Further validation and testing are needed for performance at scale and the remaining format parsers.
