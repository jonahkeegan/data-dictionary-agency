## Current Focus
Currently working on **TASK_002: Second Sprint Implementation**

We have successfully completed **SUBTASK_002.1: Implement Web UI Framework** and are now moving on to **SUBTASK_002.2: Connect Frontend to Backend API**.

### Completed Work
- Set up React/Redux frontend architecture
- Created core layout components (Header, Sidebar)
- Implemented page components:
  - Dashboard
  - Repository Browser
  - Schema Viewer
  - Visualization
  - Settings
  - NotFound (404)
- Configured Redux store with slices for data management
- Integrated Chakra UI for styling and component library
- Set up theme configuration

### Current Priority
The next phase focuses on connecting the frontend components to the backend API:
1. Ensure API endpoints are properly configured
2. Implement API integration in Redux thunks
3. Add error handling for API responses
4. Create loading states and data flow between components

### Important Components
- #UI_Framework: Core UI architecture and components
- #API_Integration: Connection between frontend and backend
- #AUTH: Authentication system (will be implemented next)

### Technical Decisions
- #UI_001: Using React with Redux for state management
- #TECH_001: Using Chakra UI for component styling

## Action Items
- [ ] Review API endpoint documentation
- [ ] Implement API service layer
- [ ] Connect Redux thunks to API service
- [ ] Add error handling and loading states
- [ ] Test API integration with mock data

## Notes
The Web UI Framework implementation has established a solid foundation for the application. The next steps will focus on making the UI functional by connecting it to the backend API services.
