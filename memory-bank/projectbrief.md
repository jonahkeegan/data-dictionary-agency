# Project Brief: Data Dictionary Agency (DDA)
timestamp: 2025-04-14T21:23:00-07:00

## Project Overview

The Data Dictionary Agency (DDA) GitHub Repository Analysis Application is a specialized data analysis tool designed to automatically scan GitHub repositories for structured data files, extract their schemas, map relationships between tables, and generate comprehensive documentation with interactive visualizations.

## Core Objectives

1. Automatically scan and analyze GitHub repositories to identify data structure files
2. Support comprehensive detection of 12 different data formats
3. Extract schema information with accurate type inference and relationship detection
4. Generate interactive visualizations that conform to industry-standard ER diagram conventions
5. Produce detailed documentation in a Swagger-like format with searchable content
6. Provide a web interface following ObservableHQ patterns for maximum usability

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Format detection accuracy | >98% across all supported formats | Validation against test repositories |
| Relationship mapping precision | >90% correctly identified | Manual verification of sample outputs |
| Processing time | <10 minutes for repositories up to 1GB | Performance testing logs |
| Documentation completeness | 100% of fields documented | Automated coverage analysis |
| User satisfaction | >4.8/5.0 | Post-usage surveys |
| Time savings | >80% compared to manual documentation | User timing studies |

## Target Audience

- **Primary**: Data engineers, database administrators, and software developers
- **Secondary**: Technical managers, system architects, and data scientists
- **Tertiary**: Compliance officers and technical documentation specialists

## Value Proposition

- **For Development Teams**: Reduce time spent manually documenting data structures by 80%
- **For Data Engineers**: Decrease data integration errors by 65% through accurate schema mapping
- **For Technical Stakeholders**: Improve decision-making with 50% faster data structure insights
- **For Compliance Officers**: Ensure 100% visibility of data structures for regulatory requirements

## High-Level Requirements

1. **Repository Integration**: Process GitHub repositories with branch selection and directory filtering
2. **Format Detection**: Support 12 data formats including JSON, CSV, XML, SQL, YAML, etc.
3. **Schema Extraction**: Extract and infer schema details from various formats
4. **Relationship Mapping**: Detect and document relationships between data structures
5. **Visualization**: Generate interactive ER diagrams with multiple layout options
6. **Documentation**: Create detailed, searchable documentation for all data structures
7. **Web Interface**: Provide an intuitive interface for exploring and sharing results

## Technical Scope

The application will be built as a modular, microservices-based architecture with:
- Repository connector for GitHub integration
- Format detection engine with plugins for 12 formats
- Relationship analysis service
- Visualization engine for ER diagrams
- Documentation generator
- Web application layer
- Persistence layer for storing results

## Project Timeline

The project will be implemented in phases:
1. Repository integration and format detection
2. Schema extraction and relationship mapping
3. Visualization and documentation generation
4. User interface and collaboration features

## Release Criteria

1. All 12 data formats reliably detected with >98% accuracy
2. Relationship detection algorithms validated across 50+ test repositories
3. Visualization rendering performs at <3 second load time for complex schemas
4. Web interface usability testing completed with >90% task success rate
5. Documentation export available in at least 3 formats (HTML, PDF, Markdown)
6. Error handling robustly manages malformed data with clear user feedback
