### First Sprint (Completed)

- [x] Initial project setup and architecture
- [x] Core backend API structure
- [x] Format detection plugins
- [x] Type inference system
- [x] Relationship detection
- [x] Repository management for external sources
- [x] Basic test suite

## Next Steps

1. Implement authentication and user management (SUBTASK_002.3)
2. Add protected routes for authenticated users
3. Create login and registration pages
4. Add end-to-end tests for UI components
5. Optimize performance and responsiveness
6. Prepare for alpha testing

## Outstanding Issues

- Need to improve error handling in API responses
- Schema relationship visualization needs performance optimization
- Mobile responsiveness needs further testing
- Authentication system needs to be integrated with frontend

## Recent Achievements

- Successfully implemented the frontend UI framework using React and Redux
- Created a comprehensive set of page components for the application
- Set up efficient state management with Redux slices
- Established consistent styling with Chakra UI theme system
- Implemented responsive layouts for all pages
- Built robust API client architecture with the following features:
  - Centralized Axios-based client with environment-specific configuration
  - Standardized error handling with error classification
  - Request cancellation system to prevent memory leaks and race conditions
  - Automatic retry mechanism for transient failures
  - Circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures
  - Service layer for repository, schema, format, and auth endpoints
  - Custom React hooks for simplified API interaction in components
  - Comprehensive unit tests for client, services, and hooks
- Implemented advanced caching system with the following features:
  - Time-to-live (TTL) based cache expiration
  - Pattern-based cache invalidation for related data
  - Configurable cache settings per service/endpoint
  - Performance optimizations for frequently accessed data
- Created sophisticated mock service architecture:
  - Centralized mock service factory for consistent mocking
  - Realistic test data for all API endpoints
  - Configurable network delays and error simulation
  - Mock data store with entity relationships
  - Environment-based switching between real and mock services
- Documented all implementations extensively:
  - Service layer architecture documentation
  - Caching strategy documentation
  - API endpoints catalog
  - Updated system patterns with sequence diagrams
