## Next Steps

1. Complete test system stabilization (SUBTASK_002.3)
   - Standardize Jest test module syntax
   - Fix import/export consistency across test files
   - Ensure proper mocking approach for React and CancelToken

## Outstanding Issues

- Jest tests failing with "ReferenceError: React is not defined" and other module-related errors
- Inconsistent module syntax between test files (ES modules vs CommonJS)
- CancelToken mocking issues in test environment
- Need to improve error handling in API responses
- Schema relationship visualization needs performance optimization
- Mobile responsiveness needs further testing
- Authentication system needs to be integrated with frontend
