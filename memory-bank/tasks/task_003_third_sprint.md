## Integration Notes

This sprint integrates the components developed in previous sprints into a cohesive, user-friendly application:

1. Advanced visualization features build upon the basic visualization engine
2. The interactive web UI provides a complete front-end for the API
3. Export capabilities allow users to leverage the analysis results in various formats
4. Performance optimizations ensure the system works well with large repositories
5. Advanced relationship detection enhances the core value proposition

Key integration points:
- Visualization engine → Web UI for interactive diagrams
- Export capabilities → Multiple output formats for versatility
- Performance optimizations → All components for scalability
- Documentation → Comprehensive coverage of all features

## Next Steps & Pending Work

After this sprint, the project will be feature complete according to the initial requirements. Future work could include:

1. Enterprise features:
   - Multi-user collaboration
   - Role-based access control
   - Audit logging
   - Custom branding

2. Advanced analytics:
   - Impact analysis for schema changes
   - Historical trend analysis
   - Data quality assessment
   - Compliance checking

3. Additional integrations:
   - CI/CD pipeline integration
   - Database system direct connections
   - Version control system hooks
   - Documentation platforms

## Testing Status

Comprehensive testing will be needed for all user-facing features:
