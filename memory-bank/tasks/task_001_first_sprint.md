## Task Definition
Implement the core infrastructure and initial format detection capabilities for the Data Dictionary Agency project. This includes setting up the project foundation, implementing the GitHub repository connector, creating the format detection framework, and developing the first two format parsers (JSON and CSV).

   - Summary: Created initial implementations for JSON and CSV parsers with format detection, schema extraction, and type inference capabilities. Added unit tests for both parsers.

## Integration Notes

The first sprint implementation has successfully established all the foundational components of the system following the architecture defined in the system patterns document. The key integration points have been implemented:

1. The GitHub Connector (#RC_GITHUB) can feed files to the Format Detection Framework (#FD_CORE)
2. The Format Detection Framework can work with the Database Schema (#DB_SCHEMA) to store detected formats and schemas
3. The Core Backend Services provide the API endpoints for initiating repository analysis and retrieving results

The implementation follows the plugin-based architecture to enable easy extension for additional formats in future sprints. The GitHub Connector uses the Adapter pattern to abstract the repository source.

## Next Steps & Pending Work

While we have successfully implemented the core infrastructure and initial format detection capabilities, there are still aspects of the first sprint that need to be completed:

1. **Additional Format Parsers**: Implement the remaining format parsers to reach all 12 targeted formats
2. **Enhanced Type Inference**: Improve the type inference capabilities for complex data structures
3. **Relationship Detection**: Develop algorithms for detecting relationships between schemas
4. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the system for large repositories and files
5. **Web UI Development**: Begin work on the web interface for interactive exploration

## Testing Status

Initial test coverage has been implemented with:
- Unit tests for format detection engine
- Basic integration tests for the API endpoints
- Test fixtures for GitHub repository simulation

Additional tests are needed for:
- Complex format detection scenarios
- Error handling and recovery
- Performance testing with large repositories

## Completion Assessment

Overall completion for TASK_001 is at approximately 60%. All core subtasks have been implemented, but additional work is needed on expanding the format parser support beyond JSON and CSV, enhancing the relationship detection capabilities, and optimizing performance for large repositories.
