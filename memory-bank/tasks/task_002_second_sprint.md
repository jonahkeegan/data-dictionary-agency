   - Dependencies: Format parsers with schema extraction
   - Completed: 2025-04-23
   - Summary: Successfully implemented a multi-strategy relationship detection system with three complementary strategies: foreign key detection, name-based inference, and structural similarity analysis. Created a comprehensive confidence scoring system for relationships with detailed metadata. Implemented utility modules for schema comparison, relationship consolidation, and type compatibility checks. Developed unit tests for all components and created documentation for the module.

4. ⏱️ SUBTASK_002.4: "Visualization Engine Foundation"

   - Dependencies: All implemented components

## Generated Decisions

- [2025-04-23] #FD_001 "Confidence-based type inference system with multiple enhancers" [Confidence: HIGH]
  - **Context**: Need accurate type detection across multiple formats
  - **Options**: 
    - Single-pass type detection: simple but limited accuracy
    - Multiple specialized type enhancers: more complex but higher accuracy
    - Machine learning-based type detection: complex, requires training data
  - **Decision**: Implement plugin-based architecture with multiple specialized enhancers
  - **Rationale**: Allows targeted approaches for different inference methods, extensible
  - **Components**: #FD_TYPEINF
  - **Status**: Implemented

## Integration Notes

This sprint focuses on expanding the capabilities built in the first sprint:

1. The additional format parsers will leverage the plugin architecture (#ARCH_002) created in the first sprint
2. The relationship detection engine will build upon the schema extraction capabilities
3. The visualization engine will implement the D3.js decision (#TECH_002)
4. The web UI will integrate with the existing API endpoints

Key integration points:
- Format parsers → Enhanced type inference → Schema extraction → Relationship detection → Visualization
- API endpoints → Web UI integration
- Test framework → Coverage for all new components

## Next Steps & Pending Work

1. Complete implementation of SUBTASK_002.1 (Additional Format Parsers)
2. Initialize work on SUBTASK_002.4 (Visualization Engine)
3. Start setting up the web UI framework (SUBTASK_002.5)
4. Continue with comprehensive testing & documentation (SUBTASK_002.6)

After this sprint, the following work will be planned for the third sprint:

1. Advanced visualization features:
   - Multiple layout algorithms
   - Customizable styling
   - Schema comparison views
   - Filtering and search capabilities
   - Export to various formats (PNG, SVG, PDF)

2. Interactive web UI development:
   - Complete repository management interface
   - Schema exploration tools
   - Visualization interaction controls
   - Documentation browsing interface
   - User preferences and settings

3. Export & integration capabilities:
   - Schema export to various formats
   - Documentation export (HTML, PDF, Markdown)
   - Integration with documentation platforms
   - API for third-party consumption

## Testing Status
