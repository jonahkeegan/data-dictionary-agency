## Task Definition
Implement the second sprint deliverables for the Data Dictionary Agency project, focusing on building the frontend UI framework, connecting it to the existing backend API, implementing authentication, and adding comprehensive testing.

## Subtasks

1. ‚úÖ SUBTASK_002.1: "Implement Web UI Framework"
   - Goal: Create the core UI components and pages using React, Redux, and Chakra UI
   - Required contexts: Frontend architecture, UI design patterns
   - Output: Functional UI components and page structure
   - Dependencies: None
   - Completed: 2025-04-27
   - Summary: Successfully implemented the Web UI Framework using React and Redux. Created the core layout components (Header, Sidebar) and page components (Dashboard, Repository Browser, Schema Viewer, Visualization, Settings, NotFound). Set up Redux store with slices for repositories, schemas, relationships, UI state, and authentication. Used Chakra UI for styling with a customized theme configuration.

2. üîÑ SUBTASK_002.2: "Connect Frontend to Backend API"
   - Goal: Integrate the frontend components with the existing backend API
   - Required contexts: API endpoints, data models, async patterns
   - Output: Working data flow between frontend and backend
   - Dependencies: SUBTASK_002.1
   - Status: In Progress

3. ‚è±Ô∏è SUBTASK_002.3: "Implement Authentication and User Management"
   - Goal: Add user authentication, authorization, and profile management
   - Required contexts: Security patterns, JWT, user workflows
   - Output: Secure user login, registration, and profile features
   - Dependencies: SUBTASK_002.2
   - Status: Not Started

4. ‚è±Ô∏è SUBTASK_002.4: "Add End-to-End Testing"
   - Goal: Implement comprehensive testing for UI components and API integration
   - Required contexts: Testing frameworks, test patterns
   - Output: Test suite with high coverage
   - Dependencies: SUBTASK_002.2, SUBTASK_002.3
   - Status: Not Started

5. ‚è±Ô∏è SUBTASK_002.5: "Optimize Performance and Responsiveness"
   - Goal: Ensure the application performs well and is responsive on all devices
   - Required contexts: Performance optimization, responsive design
   - Output: Optimized application with good performance metrics
   - Dependencies: SUBTASK_002.4
   - Status: Not Started

## Generated Decisions
- [2025-04-20] #UI_001 "React & Redux Frontend Architecture"
  - **Context**: Need to select a frontend architecture for the application
  - **Options**: 
    - Angular: Comprehensive but more complex
    - React+Redux: Flexible and widely used
    - Vue: Simpler but less community support
  - **Decision**: React with Redux for state management
  - **Rationale**: Better ecosystem, more flexible, strong community support
  - **Components**: All UI components
  - **Confidence**: HIGH

- [2025-04-22] #TECH_001 "Chakra UI Component Library"
  - **Context**: Need a UI component library for consistent styling
  - **Options**: 
    - Material UI: Comprehensive but opinionated
    - Chakra UI: Flexible, accessible, customizable
    - Tailwind CSS: Utility-first approach
  - **Decision**: Chakra UI for component styling
  - **Rationale**: Good balance of flexibility and structure, excellent accessibility support
  - **Components**: All UI components
  - **Confidence**: HIGH

## Integration Notes
- The Web UI Framework now provides a solid foundation for the application
- Redux store is set up with slices that match the backend data model
- API integration will build on the existing Redux thunks in the store slices
- All pages are implemented with responsive layouts
- Theme configuration is centralized for consistent styling
- Header and Sidebar provide application-wide navigation
- Authentication flow is prepared in Redux but needs backend integration

## Next Steps
1. Begin implementation of the API integration (SUBTASK_002.2)
2. Prepare the authentication integration points
3. Update backend API endpoints as needed to support the frontend
4. Set up test framework for UI component testing
