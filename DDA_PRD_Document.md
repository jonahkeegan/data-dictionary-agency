- Store tokens securely with proper encryption
- Support organization-level access controls
- Respect repository visibility settings
- Provide token refresh mechanisms
- Include session timeout and security controls

### Collaboration Features
The web interface should support real-time collaboration and version history:
- Implement WebSocket-based synchronization for concurrent viewers
- Provide commenting functionality on schemas and visualizations
- Track changes between analysis runs with visual diff
- Support sharing specific views via unique URLs
- Enable export/import of annotations and custom documentation
- Maintain comprehensive version history of analyses
