## Implementation Details

### Test Discovery

The system automatically discovers tests using the following patterns:
- Python tests: `test_*.py` files in the `tests/unit` and `tests/integration` directories
- JavaScript tests: `*.test.js` files in `src/ui/components/__tests__`, `src/ui/pages/__tests__`, and `src/ui/hooks/__tests__` directories

### Test Execution

Tests can be executed in several ways:
- Sequential execution of specific test suites
- Parallel execution with configurable concurrency
- Partitioned execution for CI environments

### Results Tracking

Test results are tracked in a `test-results.json` file with the following structure:
- Summary statistics (total suites, passing/failing counts, overall status)
- Detailed results for each test suite
- Individual test case results within each suite

### Reporting

Multiple report formats are supported:
- JUnit XML reports for CI integration
- HTML dashboard for human review
- Focused HTML reports for detailed suite analysis

### CI Integration

CI integration features include:
- Environment initialization
- Partitioned test execution
- Status reporting with appropriate exit codes
- Report generation for CI consumption

### Interactive Review

The interactive review interface provides:
- Test suite browsing and filtering
- Detailed results examination
- Log file browsing
- Report generation capabilities
