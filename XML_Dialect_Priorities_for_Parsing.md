## XML Dialects to Prioritize for Database Applications

When choosing which XML dialects to support in your parser—especially for database-related use cases—prioritization should be guided by industry adoption, interoperability needs, and the specific domains your application targets.

**Widely Used XML Dialects and Standards:**

- **XHTML:** Used for web page structures and widely adopted in content management and publishing[^5].
- **SOAP:** Common in enterprise environments for web services and remote method invocation[^5].
- **BPEL (Business Process Execution Language):** Used for specifying business processes, especially in workflow and integration scenarios[^5].
- **RSS and Atom:** Popular for syndication and feeds, relevant if your database interacts with content aggregation or publishing[^4].
- **Office Open XML and OpenDocument:** Used for office documents and may be relevant if your database stores or processes document data[^4].
- **SVG:** For vector graphics, important if your application handles graphical or spatial data[^4].
- **COLLADA:** Used in 3D graphics and simulation, relevant for specialized domains[^4].
- **MAVLink:** Used in robotics and drones, especially if your application targets telemetry or command/control data[^3].
- **Industry-specific dialects:** Such as HL7 (healthcare), FpML (finance), MISMO (mortgage), and NIEM (government data exchange)[^4].

**Schema Languages to Support:**

- **XSD (XML Schema Definition):** The most common schema language for defining the structure and data types of XML documents[^4].
- **DTD (Document Type Definition):** Still used, especially in legacy systems, and all XML processors are expected to support it[^5].
- **RELAX NG and Schematron:** Gaining traction for their simplicity and rule-based validation, respectively, but less universally adopted than XSD[^4].


## Recommendations

- **Prioritize XSD and DTD support** for schema validation, as these are most widely used and expected in XML processing environments[^4][^5].
- **Support key industry dialects** relevant to your application's domain (e.g., XHTML, SOAP, BPEL, RSS/Atom, HL7, FpML, etc.)[^4][^5][^1].
- **Remain extensible** so you can add support for less common or emerging dialects as needed—there are hundreds of XML dialects in use across industries[^1][^4].


## Summary Table

| XML Dialect/Standard | Typical Use Case | Priority |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| XSD (Schema) | Structure/validation for most XML | High |
| DTD | Legacy validation, basic structure | High |
| XHTML | Web content, publishing | Medium |
| SOAP | Web services, enterprise integration | Medium |
| BPEL | Business process modeling | Medium |
| RSS/Atom | Content syndication | Medium |
| Office Open XML/OpenDocument | Documents, spreadsheets, presentations | Medium |
| SVG | Vector graphics, spatial data | Medium |
| Industry-specific dialects | Healthcare, finance, government, etc. | As needed |

## Conclusion

Start by supporting XSD and DTD for schema validation, and prioritize widely adopted dialects like XHTML, SOAP, and RSS/Atom. Expand support to industry-specific dialects as dictated by your user base or integration requirements. This approach ensures broad compatibility and future-proofs your parser against evolving data exchange standards[^4][^5][^1].
