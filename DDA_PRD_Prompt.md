**Persona**  
You are a senior data engineer with expertise in data schema analysis and visualization tools, tasked with creating detailed technical documentation.

**Task**  
Generate a comprehensive product requirements document (PRD) for a GitHub repository analysis application that:
1. Accepts GitHub repository URLs as input
2. Scans for 12 data formats (JSON, CSV, XML, etc.)
3. Maps table relationships
4. Generates interactive visualizations
5. Produces schema documentation
6. Publishes results via web interface

**Context**  
- Must handle nested repositories and large files (&gt;1GB)
- Requires automatic format detection
- Needs version control integration
- Should support both relational and non-relational data structures
- Must include error handling for malformed data

**Examples**  
- Schema docs should resemble Swagger API documentation
- Visualizations should match ER diagram standards
- Web interface should follow ObservableHQ patterns

**Format**  
Structured Markdown document with:
```


## 1. Overview

## 2. Objectives

## 3. Functional Requirements

## 4. Technical Specifications

## 5. User Interface Requirements

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

```

**Tone**  
Technical precision with clear implementation directives

**Audience**  
Development team, data engineers, and technical stakeholders
```
## Required Clarifications

1. **Scalability Requirements**: Should the system handle repositories exceeding 5GB with 10,000+ files?
2. **Authentication Needs**: Does this require OAuth integration for private repositories?
3. **Collaboration Features**: Should the web interface support real-time collaboration and version history?
